# Serial Port Data Reader

This script is designed to read data from a serial port using a shell script.

## Usage

1. Ensure the correct serial port (`/dev/ttymxc0`) is specified in the script.
2. Configure the serial port settings using `stty`.
3. Run the script to read data continuously from the serial port.

## Script Details

- The script uses a `while` loop to continuously read data from the specified serial port.
- It uses the `dd` command to read 4 bytes of data at a time (`bs=4`).

## Configuration

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the serial port (`/dev/ttymxc0`) before running the script.
